# Breast Cancer Prediction System

This repository contains code for a Breast Cancer prediction system built using machine learning algorithms. The system utilizes the Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the prediction system is the Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from Kaggle. It consists of various features extracted from digitized images of breast mass and associated diagnosis labels (benign or malignant).

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The following machine learning algorithms are implemented for training and prediction:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Features

The Breast Cancer prediction system offers the following features:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Prediction of breast cancer diagnosis (benign or malignant) based on input features.
- Visualization of important features and model performance metrics.

## Prerequisites

To run the prediction system, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.0 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashwinimishra24/Breast_Cancer_Classifier.git
